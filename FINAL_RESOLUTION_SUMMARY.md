# Final Resolution Summary - MythicWebsite

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Admin Panel 403 Forbidden Errors
**Problem**: `UserManagement.tsx:112 GET .../auth/v1/admin/users 403 (Forbidden)`
**Root Cause**: Using `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()` which requires service role keys
**Solution**: 
- Replaced `UserManagement` component with `SimplifiedUserManagement`
- Updated `src/pages/Admin.tsx` to import and use the new component
- New component only uses `user_profiles` and `user_roles` tables accessible with RLS

### 2. Payment Config 406 Not Acceptable Errors  
**Problem**: `GET .../payment_configurations?select=...&provider=eq.stripe&is_enabled=eq.true 406 (Not Acceptable)`
**Root Cause**: Query syntax and missing data handling issues
**Solutions Applied**:
- Updated `PaymentConfigService.getConfig()` to use `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()`
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Created graceful fallbacks for missing payment configurations
- Added `isProviderEnabled()` method with direct DB queries
- Enhanced error messaging in admin components

### 3. Build and Migration Issues
**Problem**: Various build warnings and database migration conflicts
**Solutions Applied**:
- Verified successful production builds (`npm run build`)
- Created migration for default payment configurations
- Updated RLS policies for public payment config access
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
