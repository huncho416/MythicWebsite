# Security Notes for MythicWebsite

## Payment Security

### Stripe Integration
- **API Keys**: Never expose secret keys in client-side code. Only use publishable keys on the frontend.
- **Webhook Verification**: Always verify webhook signatures using the webhook secret to ensure authenticity.
- **Idempotency**: Implement idempotency keys for payment operations to prevent duplicate charges.
- **Test Mode**: Always use test mode during development. Production keys should only be used in production.

### PayPal Integration
- **Client Credentials**: Keep client secrets secure and never expose them in frontend code.
- **Webhook Verification**: Verify PayPal webhooks using certificate validation or webhook signature verification.
- **Environment Separation**: Use sandbox environment for development and live environment for production.

### General Payment Security
- **PCI Compliance**: Never store card details on your servers. Use payment processor tokens instead.
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for all payment-related communications.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all payment amounts, currencies, and order data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints to prevent abuse.

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Orders**: Users can only view their own orders. Admins can view all orders.
- **Payment Logs**: Only accessible by system admins for security monitoring.
- **Command Logs**: Only accessible by admins who need to monitor command execution.
- **User Profiles**: Users can only edit their own profiles.

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: Hash or encrypt sensitive information like RCON passwords.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain audit trails for all administrative actions.
- **Data Retention**: Implement data retention policies for payment logs and personal data.

## RCON Security

### Remote Console Access
- **Network Security**: RCON should only be accessible from trusted networks.
- **Password Strength**: Use strong, unique passwords for RCON access.
- **Command Validation**: Validate and sanitize all commands before execution.
- **Server-Side Only**: RCON operations must only be performed server-side, never from client browsers.

### Command Execution
- **Template Validation**: Validate command templates to prevent injection attacks.
- **User Input Sanitization**: Sanitize usernames and other user inputs in commands.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit command execution frequency to prevent server overload.
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive server information in error messages.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- **Supabase Auth**: Leverage Supabase's built-in authentication with proper session management.
- **Role-Based Access**: Implement proper role-based access control for admin functions.
- **Session Security**: Use secure session handling with appropriate timeouts.

### Admin Panel Security
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Consider implementing MFA for admin accounts.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.
- **Activity Logging**: Log all admin activities for security monitoring.

## API Security

### Webhook Endpoints
- **Authentication**: Verify webhook signatures to prevent unauthorized requests.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error responses.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor webhook endpoints for unusual activity.

### Data Validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Schema Validation**: Validate data against expected schemas.
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for type safety and validation.

## Infrastructure Security

### Environment Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
- **Secrets Management**: Use proper secrets management for production deployments.
- **Network Security**: Implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation.

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Security Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activities and security events.
- **Error Logging**: Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive data.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual performance patterns that might indicate attacks.

## Development Security

### Code Security
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Code Review**: Implement code review processes for security-sensitive changes.
- **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to identify potential security issues.

### Testing Security
- **Security Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing of the application.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated vulnerability scanning tools.

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **GDPR Compliance**: Implement appropriate data handling for EU users.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary user data.
- **User Rights**: Implement user rights like data deletion and portability.

### Financial Compliance
- **Transaction Records**: Maintain proper transaction records for audit purposes.
- **Refund Policies**: Implement clear refund policies and procedures.
- **Tax Compliance**: Consider tax implications for digital goods sales.

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
- **Response Plan**: Have a clear incident response plan for security breaches.
- **Communication**: Establish communication procedures for security incidents.
- **Recovery Procedures**: Document recovery procedures for various incident types.

### Business Continuity
- **Backup Procedures**: Implement regular backup procedures for critical data.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Have disaster recovery plans for critical systems.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and alerting for system health.
