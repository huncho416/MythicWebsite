## Browser Console Debugging
Open browser DevTools and check for:
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Debug messages should show:
  - "üîß Opening edit dialog for category: [object]"
  - "üìù Setting form data: [object]"
  - "üö™ Opening dialog after state update"
  - "üíæ Updating category with form data: [object]" (on update)
  - "‚úÖ Category updated successfully" (on success)

## Acceptance Criteria
‚úÖ Edit button opens working edit interface
‚úÖ Form fields populated with current category data
‚úÖ Validation errors show inline via toast
‚úÖ Success shows toast notification
‚úÖ Category list updates without full page reload
‚úÖ All form fields work correctly (text inputs, selects, color picker)
‚úÖ Cancel button properly resets and closes dialog
‚úÖ Error handling provides user feedback

## Performance Requirements
- Dialog should open within 100ms of clicking edit button
- Form should be populated immediately when dialog opens
- Update operation should complete within 2 seconds
- No memory leaks or React warnings in console

## Known Issues Fixed
1. **Blank page issue**: Fixed by adding proper state management and error handling
2. **Form not populating**: Fixed by ensuring proper data flow from category to form state
3. **Validation missing**: Added client-side validation for required fields
4. **Poor error feedback**: Enhanced error messages and user feedback
5. **State management**: Improved dialog state handling with proper cleanup

## Security Considerations
- All database updates use parameterized queries through Supabase
- Form inputs are validated and sanitized
- Admin role permissions are checked before allowing edits
- CSRF protection through Supabase client
