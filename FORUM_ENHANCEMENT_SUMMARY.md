## Completed Tasks

### 1. Admin Forum Category Edit Bug Fix âœ…
**Issue**: The admin panel "Edit Category" dialog (pencil icon) was opening a blank page.

**Root Cause**: Radix UI Select component doesn't accept empty string values, causing the form to break.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `ForumManagement.tsx` to use "none" as the default value instead of empty strings
- Updated form state handling to map "none" to `null` for database operations  
- Fixed all permission-related Select components (read, write, moderate permissions)
- Cleaned up state management and removed debug code

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/admin/ForumManagement.tsx`

**Testing**: Manual testing confirmed the edit dialog now works correctly.
