# Admin Panel Cleanup - Unused Components Removal

## Summary
This document details the removal of unused admin panel components that were replaced by improved versions.

## ✅ Removed Files

### 1. **UserManagement.tsx** ❌ (REMOVED)
**Replaced by**: `SimplifiedUserManagement.tsx`

**Reason for removal**:
- Used forbidden Supabase Auth admin API calls (`supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()`)
- Caused 403 Forbidden errors
- Replaced with a simplified version that only uses accessible database tables

### 2. **StoreManagement.tsx** ❌ (REMOVED)  
**Replaced by**: `EnhancedStoreManagement.tsx`

**Reason for removal**:
- Basic functionality compared to enhanced version
- Enhanced version includes image upload, payment configuration, and better UI
- No longer needed as all functionality migrated to enhanced version

### 3. **ModerationManagement_temp.tsx** ❌ (REMOVED)
**Reason for removal**:
- Temporary file that was no longer needed
- Cleanup of development artifacts
