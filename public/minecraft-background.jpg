/* Minecraft Background Image Placeholder
   
   To add a real Minecraft background:
   1. Take a high-quality Minecraft screenshot (1920x1080 or higher)
   2. Save it as minecraft-background.jpg in this folder
   3. Replace this placeholder file
   
   For now, the CSS will use the fallback pattern.
